"""Qupacabrathon 2026 submission script for the odd-cycle nonlocal game.

Copy this file to `submissions/<your-team>_run1.py`, fill in `build_circuits`,
set the parameter block, and open a pull request. An organizer checks your branch
out and runs it against the event key. Nobody touches hardware interactively, so
that one file is the whole submission. This template stays as it is: it is what
the next copy starts from.

    uv run --python 3.12 submissions/<your-team>_run1.py

The code you add here is small on purpose. `build_circuits` is the one function
your team fills in, and the parameter block above it is where the decisions that
differentiate teams land: which n, how many shots, whether to pay for twirled
variants, informed by what your run 1 measured. The experiment is the work and
this file is its instrument. Everything outside those two places is fixed so
that twelve submissions have a common surface a checker can validate and a
mentor can read, and editing it means your run is no longer the run that was
checked.

The script writes `counts.json` and `benchmark.json` into
`results/<your-team>_run<N>/`. That is exactly the shape the results database
expects, so an organizer files the result without transforming anything.

Before you open the pull request:

    uv run --python 3.12 scripts/submission_check.py submissions/<your-team>_run1.py

Every bound, shot count and price this script prints comes from
`scripts/game_numbers.py`. Nothing is restated here, so a number can never drift
between the rules and the run.

# Shots per circuit. Every one of the 2n circuits gets exactly this many, and
# the verifier rejects a submission where they differ. Size it with
# `scripts/plan_check.py` before you submit, because both the certification gate
# and the bill are decided here. The published tables are S_90: the smallest
# count that certifies with 90% probability at the deficit you declared below.
# Buying the bare minimum instead puts the expected outcome exactly at the gate
# and fails about half the time.
SHOTS = 380

# Pauli-twirled circuit variants per question. 1 submits your circuit exactly
# as you wrote it. At k > 1, each question is submitted as k variants, each
# wrapping every CNOT in fresh random Pauli frames with the compensating pair
# after it, and each variant runs SHOTS / k shots, so SHOTS stays your total
# per question and has to divide by k. Every frame is the same unitary as your
# circuit, so the pooled counts are the same honest trials the certification
# counts. What twirling changes is the device's error, folding coherent error
# on the entangling gate into a stochastic channel. The price is real: one
# task fee per variant, so k twirls multiply the $0.30 task term by k while
# the shot term stays put. Whether it buys anything on this device is
# unmeasured, which is what makes it a bet rather than a default. See the
# Challenge Instructions, What you may change about the run.
TWIRLS = 1

# Which QPU this run goes to: "emerald" or "garnet", both IQM superconducting
# devices reached through qBraid. This is your choice and it is a real one, and
# it changes two separate things.
#
# It changes the price. Both devices charge $0.30 per circuit task; Emerald
# charges $0.0016 per shot and Garnet $0.00145, so a shot-heavy sweep is about
# 9% cheaper on Garnet and a task-heavy one costs the same on both. Every price
# this script prints is computed at the rate for the device named here.
#
# It changes the error rates, and so the shot count. The Background Notes carry
# a table of what each vendor publishes. A worse device needs more shots for
# the same certification, and the shots a certification needs grow like the
# inverse square of the margin, so a difference in error rates usually swamps a
# 10% difference in the per-shot rate.
#
# You name the device, never the route that reaches it. The organizer's
# environment maps this label to a route at execution time, which is what lets
# a device be swapped for its fallback without touching a submission.
QPU = "emerald"

# The device deficit you are sizing this run against: how far below the ideal
# quantum win rate you expect the hardware to land, omega = omega_q - delta.
#
# The event publishes no value for this. It is the number your experiment is
# designed on, and reaching a defensible one is most of the design work. Two
# routes. Predict it: the Background Notes derive the law that turns a readout
# error rate into a deficit, and carry the published error rates for both
# devices. Or measure it: a cheap sweep at low n returns a win rate, and
# omega_q(n) minus that win rate is delta, measured on the device you will
# commit on. Because delta does not depend on n, one cheap run sizes every
# later one.
#
# Nothing checks this against the device before you spend. `plan_check.py`
# checks only that your shot count and your budget are consistent with the
# number you declared. Declaring a deficit better than the truth means the gate
# passes here and the hardware certifies nothing; declaring one worse means you
# over-buy shots and pay for it on the design award. Both are priced, and both
# are your call.
DELTA = 0.0286

# The one line that differs between a practice run and a hardware run, and it
# is not yours to set: leave it as it ships. An organizer swaps this single
# string to "qbraid" at execution time, after a mentor approved the pull
# request, which is why a script that runs by accident spends nothing and why
# you hold no key. On the organizer machine the "qbraid" route resolves your
# QPU label above through their environment, so no route string ever appears in
# this file and a device can be swapped for its fallback without touching a
# single submission. `check_environment` below stops a "qbraid" run whose
# environment carries no route or no credential before the first shot.
DEVICE = "default.qubit"

# Everything above is read once, before your code runs, and the run is executed
# from that snapshot. Reassigning any of it later changes nothing except that the
# script stops, because the parameters an organizer approved on the pull request
# have to be the parameters that spend the money.

def build_circuits(n: int, theta: float) -> list[Callable[[], None]]:
    """Build one sweep of the odd-cycle game: the instrument your experiment runs on.

    This is the function your team fills in. The circuit itself is settled
    physics, derived to the last step in the Background Notes, and filling it
    in correctly is the floor rather than the contest. What stays yours is the
    experiment built around it: the angle functions are the one place a
    coherent device bias can be countered from your own run 1 profile, and the
    parameter block above prices every other decision.

    Returns a list of exactly `2 * n` functions, one per question, in the order
    `question_order(n)` returns:

        (0, 0), (1, 1), ..., (n - 1, n - 1),
        (0, 1), (1, 2), ..., (n - 1, 0)

    Entry `k` of your list is the circuit for question `k` of that list. The
    order is not checked against anything, so getting it wrong scores your
    answers against the wrong questions and reports a loss with no error raised.

    Each entry takes no arguments and applies gates to two wires: wire 0 is the
    first player and wire 1 is the second. It returns nothing. `main` attaches
    `qml.sample(wires=[0, 1])` and owns the measurement, which is how every
    circuit is guaranteed the same `SHOTS` honest trials.

    So a single circuit is a function of this shape:

        def circuit():
            qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
            ...

    `theta` is the angle whose cosine squared is the quantum bound. It is the
    only quantity in the circuit that depends on `n`. What your strategy does
    with it is your decision, and you are free to ignore it.

    One shape is fixed, because it is what the classical bound is a statement
    about. The gates up to and including the last two-qubit gate are the shared
    state the players agreed on before any question arrived, so they are
    identical in all 2n circuits. Everything after them is single-qubit: wire 0's
    gates may depend only on `x` and wire 1's only on `y`. Players who can read
    each other's questions beat every bound in the Challenge Instructions
    without any physics, so `scripts/submission_check.py` rebuilds these
    circuits and compares the two that share each player's question, gate for
    gate, before anything runs.

    A worked derivation of what these circuits have to do, and why one Bell pair
    and one rotation per player is enough, is in the Background Notes at
    https://qupacabrathon.dev.

    Measured on `iqm:garnet` on 2026-08-18: the backend folds an `RY` angle into
    roughly `(-pi/2, pi/2]` below the QASM this script emits. That is not a
    harmless wrap. `RY(theta + pi) = -i * Y * RY(theta)`, so dropping a pi flips
    the qubit, and a strategy whose questions differ by a step of `pi - pi/n`
    collapses onto a single question. A `C_7` sweep whose angles were correct in
    the emitted QASM came back at a win rate of 0.4996, chance, against 0.9858
    for the same file on the simulator. The two evidence circuits: `RY(-pi)` on
    one half of a Bell pair returned `P(same) = 0.9788` where the exact answer is
    0, and the same rotation written as `Y` returned 0.0318. The 2026-08-19
    Emerald session ran this exact rewrite and certified at `n = 5`, so on the
    event device, which shares the IQM compiler stack, the workaround is
    validated empirically rather than assumed to transfer.

    So the pi is carried by a Pauli, which no angle folding can touch, and only
    the remainder is left in an angle. `math.remainder` returns `r` in
    `[-pi/2, pi/2]` by construction, which is inside the range the backend keeps.

    The rewrite is exact rather than approximate. It agrees with `RY(theta)` up to
    a global phase, verified to 1.7e-16 in the Bell-pair probabilities across the
    angles this game generates, so the simulator cannot tell the two apart and the
    number the gate prints is the number the run is trying to reproduce.

    This sits below the FIXED line because it is a property of the device rather
    than of any team's strategy. A team writes `qml.RY` in `build_circuits` and
